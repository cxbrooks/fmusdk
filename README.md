# fmusdk

Port of FMUSDK 1.0 from QTronic (http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmusdk.zip) to Mac OS X and Linux.

This port supports only FMU Version 1.0 and is no longer maintained.

See [https://github.com/cxbrooks/fmusdk2](https://github.com/cxbrooks/fmusdk2) for support for FMU 1.0 and FMU 2.0

The original README said:

This is an SDK (originally developed by QTronic) for testing the  
Functional Mockup Interface developed by the Modelisar project.
